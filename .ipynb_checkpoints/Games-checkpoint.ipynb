    "#### 1. Describe Dataset\n",
    "- **Who:** The data was acquired from Kaggle and supplied by the user Gregory Smith (https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/videogamesales). The data was scraped from www.vgchartz.com. \n",
    "- **What:** The dataset contains a list of video games with sales greater than 100,000 from 1980 to 2011. It contains information such as the platform the game was made available, year of release, genre, publisher, sales in NA, sales in JP, sales in EU, sales in the rest of the world and global sales (total). The data set also includes the rank of games in terms of overall sales. **NOTE: Sales are in millions**\n",
    "- **When:** The data set was last updated 4 years ago but contains games released from 1980 to seemingly 2017. \n",
    "- **Why:** The video game industry is a very competitive yet profitable industry. While big companies with large amounts of resources have an edge over smaller companies, we have recently seen many small companies finding huge success. Not only in game creation but in the case of streamers for example, playing a game before it becomes mainstream might give you an edge against bigger name streamers. With this data set, we are able to gain insight into general idea such as performance of companies, most popular titles and genres. We are also able to dive deeper and look at changing genre popularities over time, regional preference in game genres/platforms, upcoming developer etc.  \n",
    "- **How:** The data set was scraped from the www.vgzchartz.com website using BeautifulSoup. The scraping script can be found here (https://github.com/GregorUT/vgchartzScrape)"
